# ExerciseSelector
## Style

This project is written in the concept of _rapid prototyping_. This means, it's only supposed to work, not to be expandable, readable, debuggable, ...
In short, it is horrible code that didn't take long to write.

## What does it do?

This is an android app randomly selecting my math exercises, priorizing the sheets I'm less good at.
